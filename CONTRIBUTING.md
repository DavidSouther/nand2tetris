## Issues & Pull Requests

- Send pull requests to the `main` branch.
- Please use the `bug` and `enhancement` tags when creating general issues.
- Issues tagged `good first issue` are expected to be small, focused changes to contained parts of the codebase.
- Many parts of Hack are not yet implemented. If the feature is part of the core hack book, add the issue to the `Book Parity` milestone and either the `HDL`, `CPU`, or `VM` project as appropriate.
